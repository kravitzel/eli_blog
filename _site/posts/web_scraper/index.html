<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.sba.gov/local-assistance/resource-partners/small-business-development-centers-sbdc" title="Small Business Administration's SBDC page">Small Business Development Centers</a> (SBDCs) provide counseling and resources to entrepreneurs and small business owners. SBDCs are typically funded by federal, state, and local governments and partnerships with educational institutions, economic development agencies, and private organizations. The primary goal of SBDCs</p>
<p>is to support the growth and development of small businesses in their communities.</p>
<p>We were ask to compile a comprehensive list of SBDCs. Additionally, we were required to outline the specific services offered by each SBDC (such as business counseling, tax assistance, etc.) and provide details about the staff ar each center.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-pivot-to-ai" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-pivot-to-ai">The Pivot to AI</h2>
<p>Finding a list of all SBDCs was straightforward; they can be scraped from the <a href="https://americassbdc.org/find-your-sbdc/" title="America's SBDC Find Your SBDC tool">Find Your SBDC tool</a> provided by America’s SBDC. We found over 700 SBDCs using this tool, each with their own unique website. Manually going through each page is not feasible. Our original plan to extract relevant information with XPath or CSS selectors was not possible. SBDC websites are not standardized. Building selectors that generally work over such a wide variety of websites is impossible.</p>
<p>For each of the 700+ SBDC websites we use Python’s <a href="https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/" title="Beautiful Soup homepage">Beautiful Soup</a> library to retrieve the text from every subpage of the SBDC’s website. Ideally, we would provide all this text to ChatGPT API as context in a prompt then ask ChatGPT to retrieve the staff and services for us. GPT-4 has a 8194 token limit (≈3000 words) which includes the response from GPT-4. We limit our context to 3000 tokens to leave tokens remaining for our prompt and answer.</p>
<p>This approach is adapted from <a href="https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook/blob/main/apps/web-crawl-q-and-a/web-qa.ipynb" title="Webcrawler Jupyter Notebook">webcrawler notebook</a> from the <a href="https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook" title="OpenAI Cookbook">OpenAI Cookbook</a>.</p>

The SBA does not offer grants to start or expand small businesses, although it does offer a wide variety of loan programs. SBA does offer some grant programs, but these generally support non-profit organizations, intermediary lending institutions, and state and local governments. Click here for more information > What is a business plan and why do I need one? A business plan is a road map for the direction of your company and specifically defines your business and clearly states your goals. In addition, a good business plan is a crucial part of any loan package because it provides specific and organized information about your company and how you will repay borrowed money. Click here for more information > What types of permits and licenses are generally needed for starting a business? In addition to local permits and licenses which may be required, some businesses require specific licenses from the State of Texas. For a complete list of Business Licenses and Permits required for each type of business Click Here > Do I need a Federal Employer Identification Number (EIN) or tax number? In some cases, some sole proprietors with no employees and no sales tax can simply use their own social security number for tax purposes, but most businesses will need an EIN. You can apply by phone, fax, or mail. Click here for an SS-4 Form > Who is required to hold a Texas sales & use tax permit, and how do I get one?

The SBA does not offer grants to start or expand small businesses, although it does offer a wide variety of loan programs. SBA does offer some grant programs, but these generally support non-profit organizations, intermediary lending institutions, and state and local governments. Click here for more information > What is a business plan and why do I need one? A business plan is a road map for the direction of your company and specifically defines your business and clearly states your goals. In addition, a good business plan is a crucial part of any loan package because it provides specific and organized information about your company and how you will repay borrowed money. Click here for more information > What types of permits and licenses are generally needed for starting a business? In addition to local permits and licenses which may be required, some businesses require specific licenses from the State of Texas. For a complete list of Business Licenses and Permits required for each type of business Click Here > Do I need a Federal Employer Identification Number (EIN) or tax number? In some cases, some sole proprietors with no employees and no sales tax can simply use their own social security number for tax purposes, but most businesses will need an EIN. You can apply by phone, fax, or mail. Click here for an SS-4 Form > Who is required to hold a Texas sales & use tax permit, and how do I get one?

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="embedding-text">Embedding Text</h3>
<p>Note: You’ll need to make an access key for OpenAI to run any of the code in this section</p>
<p>Then we create embeddings for each page using the OpenAI API. Embeddings translate text into numeric vectors. When two vector embeddings are close to each other (low distance), we expect the text to be similar in meaning. OpenAI offers a number of <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings" title="OpenAI embeddings">embedding models</a> for users to choose from. At the time of writing this, <code>text-embedding-ada-002</code> is is the cheapest option and <a href="https://openai.com/blog/new-and-improved-embedding-model" title="Comparing OpenAI embedding models">outperforms the other models</a>.</p>
<p>Below is example code (not run), to show how to use OpenAI embedding models. (I didn’t want to pay for any more uses of the OpenAI API or host a reproducible example on this site. )</p>
