This presentation began as a proposed design for a Phase 2 trial. After Phase 1 results, development was stopped and this trial was never considered. I reworked the presentation into a tutorial/workshop for using graphical testing in a multi-arm trial. This was my first experiment with plotly and Rmarkdown slides, so excuse any strange formatting.
