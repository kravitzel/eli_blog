This is an *old* presentation. When I was getting ready to finish my PhD, this is what I presented whenever I was asked to give a talk during an interview.

We developed physical activity guidelines by fitting shaped constrained regression models to self-reported physical activity questionnaires. We scaled the model's fitted values so they were between 0 and 100, with 0 indicate extremely poor levels of physical activity and 100 representation perfect levels of physical activity.
